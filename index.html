            <p>
                My name is Travis McDonald and I'm currently a composite manufacturer. I'm a father of four beautiful children and am looking to become a web developer.
                I enjoy fishing, hunting, camping and being with my children as much as possible. I love watching my sons play baseball and football and my daughters gymnastics and dance recitels. 
                My entire adult life I have been in the aerospace field in some way shape or form. Right out of highschool I worked at Salt Lake International Airport fueling planes. I then started working for my current employer Hexcel Corp. building carbon fiber.
                 I have enjoyed working for Hexcel and learning about the aerospace industry but am now looking for a new career that allows me to spend more time with my children during these valueable years of their young lives.
                I've always been intrigued and fascinated with the inner workings of front end and back end web development. I have enjoyed and embraced this new journey of my life and am excited to see what the future holds for me in this field.
